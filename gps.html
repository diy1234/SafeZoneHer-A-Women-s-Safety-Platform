            <h2>GPS Locations</h2>
            <p>GPS locations are enabled to assist parents with their grievances and emergencies. At SAFEZONE, we understand the importance of ensuring the safety and well-being of children. By utilizing GPS technology, parents can quickly locate their children in case of emergencies or when they feel concerned about their whereabouts.</p>
            <p>Our GPS system is designed to provide real-time location updates, allowing parents to track their children's movements and ensure their safety. Whether it's monitoring their journey to and from school, tracking their whereabouts during outdoor activities, or responding to emergency situations, our GPS locations feature provides peace of mind to parents.</p>
            <p>In addition to GPS tracking, our platform also offers features such as geofencing, which allows parents to set up virtual boundaries and receive alerts when their children enter or leave designated areas. This functionality enhances parental control and helps ensure that children stay safe and secure at all times.</p>

            <h2>Emergency Button</h2>
            <p>In case of emergencies, we provide an emergency button for immediate assistance. By clicking the "Emergency" button below, you can alert our support team and provide them with your current GPS location. This feature enables us to respond promptly to your emergency situation and provide the necessary assistance.</p>
            <p>Our support team is trained to handle various emergency scenarios, including medical emergencies, accidents, and safety threats. Upon receiving your emergency alert, we will dispatch help to your location and coordinate with local authorities if necessary.</p>
            <p>It's important to note that the emergency button should only be used in genuine emergency situations where immediate assistance is required. Misuse of the emergency feature may result in delays in responding to genuine emergencies and can hinder our ability to provide timely assistance to those in need.</p>
