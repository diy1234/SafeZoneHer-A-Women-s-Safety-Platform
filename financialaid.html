            <h2>Legal Aid</h2>
            <p>Legal aid is crucial for women navigating legal challenges, such as domestic violence, divorce, child custody, and employment discrimination. Here are some options for accessing legal aid:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Legal Aid Organizations: Many nonprofit legal aid organizations provide free or low-cost legal services to individuals who cannot afford private attorneys.

                <li>Pro Bono Services: Some law firms and individual attorneys offer pro bono services, which involve providing legal assistance for free or at a reduced rate to clients in need.

                <li>Government Legal Aid Programs: Government-funded legal aid programs may be available at the local, state, or federal level to provide legal assistance to low-income individuals and families. These programs may offer legal advice, representation in court, and assistance with legal paperwork.</li>
                <li>Hotlines and Helplines: Many organizations operate hotlines and helplines that provide legal information, advice, and referrals to women in need.
